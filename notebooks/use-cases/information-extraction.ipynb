    "\n",
    "Docling supports different template formats for [information extraction](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/examples/extraction/). Templates define the structure and data types of the information you want to extract from documents.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Template Selection Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String templates**: Simple JSON format, fastest to write and good for basic extractions\n",
    "  - Best for: Quick prototyping, simple data structures, minimal setup\n",
    "  - Example use case: Extracting just a few basic fields like invoice number and total\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary templates**: Python dictionaries, provides better integration with Python code  \n",
    "  - Best for: Structured data with nested objects, better Python integration\n",
    "  - Example use case: When you need nested data structures or complex field relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pydantic model templates**: Recommended for production use with type validation\n",
    "  - Best for: Production applications, type safety, complex data structures, documentation\n",
    "  - Example use case: Enterprise applications where data validation and type safety are critical\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pydantic instance templates**: Useful when you need specific default values that override the model defaults\n",
    "  - Best for: When you have contextual information that should be used as fallbacks\n",
    "  - Example use case: Processing invoices from a specific vendor where you know the vendor name but want to extract it if present, or using a known invoice series number as a fallback\n",
    "  - **Why this matters**: In our sample invoice, if the vendor name isn't clearly extractable but you're processing a batch from \"WordPress Invoice Plugin\", you can set that as the default while still allowing extraction to override it\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later cell you'll choose which template format to use for the actual extraction."

    "\n",
    "- **Successful extraction**: When the extractor finds the requested information, it will return the structured data in the format specified by your template\n",
    "- **Missing fields**: Optional fields may be `None` or use default values if the information isn't found in the document\n",
    "- **Data types**: Results will be converted to the specified types (string, float, int, etc.) when possible\n",
    "- **Confidence**: The accuracy depends on document quality, field descriptiveness, and template complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pydantic Instance Template Results Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "If you chose the `pydantic_instance` template, you'll see how contextual defaults work in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`invoice_number` and `total`**: These will be extracted from the actual invoice document if found\n",
    "- **`vendor_name`**: If the vendor name isn't clearly visible or extractable from our sample invoice, the fallback \"WordPress Invoice Plugin\" will be used instead of `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be very useful in scenarios where we happen to have available context that is more relevant than the default values predefined in the model definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the results below:\n",
    "- `invoice_number` and `total` are actually set from the values extracted from the document data\n",
    "- If there was no clear `vendor_name` to be extracted, the updated default \"WordPress Invoice Plugin\" we provided would be applied instead of the model's default `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimenting with Different Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily experiment with different template formats by going back to the template selection cell and changing the `template_to_use` variable, then re-running the extraction. Try comparing the `pydantic_model` vs `pydantic_instance` results to see how the contextual defaults affect the output."
